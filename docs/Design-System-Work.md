# Design System Work

The Hack for LA Design system is always evolving.

## Current Challenges
- Inconsistent Usage
  - The Design System isn’t consistently being used, and to its full potential. We also noticed that the Typography needs to be revised because the only difference between text variations are the size and boldness of them.   We will start to find ways for the design system to be more effectively and efficiently used. How can we improve the design system to be more useful? How can we revise the text titles and headers in the design system to work better together without size and boldness of fonts being the only variation options? 

## Areas for improvement (not an exhaustive list).
This section should get compared to the open issues and determine what issues still need to be made and what issues address these listed areas.
- Make sure the latest Figma designs are using the Design System’s components and styles.
- Connect all of the latest screen design’s components with the design system
- Revise typography styles
- Connect with the Design team to bring our design system up to current standards.
