**Click Attribution**

From FullStory: “We currently use a combination of inferred page and intelligently processed CSS selector to identify and attribute clicks. Sometimes a given CSS selector can match multiple elements in the page. We currently attribute clicks to the first element we encounter. This generally isn’t a problem if the element or it’s parents have sufficient detail with href’s, class names or IDs in the HTML. That being said, we can do better and have a solution in the works to properly attribute clicks to ambiguous elements like this.”
