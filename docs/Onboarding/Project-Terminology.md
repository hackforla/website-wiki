## Software Development Lifecycle Terms

The below terms describe parts of the software development lifecycle for HFLA Website 2.0.

_**feature**_

A product feature is a characteristic of your product that describe its appearance, components, and capabilities. Put another way, it is a slice of business functionality that has a corresponding benefit or set of benefits for that product's end user.

_**user story**_

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. It describes the type of user, what they want and why and helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

_**customer research**_

Customer research is the process of identifying customer segments, needs, and behaviors. Customer research may be carried out as part of market research, user research, or design research.

_**acceptance criteria**_

Acceptance criteria refers to a set of predefined requirements that must be met in order to mark a user story complete. Acceptance criteria are also sometimes called the “definition of done.” They determine the scope and requirements that must be executed by developers to consider a user story finished.

_**QA**_

Software QA is the process of ensuring software quality. It often includes tasks like functional testing and source code quality and performance testing.

_**usability standards**_

Usability falls under the broader discipline of user experience and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. These standards include compliance with ADA standards, which refer to the Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design.

## Project management terms 

_**agile**_

An iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. [1][2]

_**kanban**_

A popular framework used to implement agile software development. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time. [2]

_**scrum**_

A software development framework that describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve. [2]

_**user-centered design**_

User-centered design (UCD) or user-driven development (UDD) is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. [4]


## Scrum methodology

_**acceptance criteria**_

Predefined conditions that a software product must satisfy in order to mark a user story complete. [1][2] 

_**epic**_

A large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller user stories. [2]

_**sprint/iteration**_

A short period in which the development team implements and delivers a discrete and potentially shippable application increment (e.g. a working milestone version). [2]

_**user story**_

Development tasks often expressed as “persona + need + purpose." [2]

_**velocity**_

The average amount of work a scrum team completes during a sprint. This can be measured in either "story points" or number of issues. [2]
