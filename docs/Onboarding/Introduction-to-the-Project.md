## Hack for LA Website (HfLA website, HackforLA.org)

The HackforLA.org website’s purpose is to connect volunteers with projects, express Code for America and Hack for LA’s shared mission, and demonstrate that we are producing valuable projects with tangible impact.  

The website is also the starting place for new developers to master docker, git, and github, and to practice working collaboratively on a multidisciplinary team.

### History

The earliest version of this website had just one page. The site displayed a handful of projects and an email signup form, with a focus on encouraging people to attend our 3 weekly hack nights (with information posted on meetup). 

The new website team formed around a desire to have a more flexible website that would be easier to update and expand.

The primary function of the Hack for LA website is to recruit and match prospective volunteers to ongoing technology projects. The website must achieve two key goals:

1. Present a clear and compelling value proposition for participation;
1. Enable interested volunteers to identify and join projects that align with their areas of interest and skills.  

Earlier HFLA discovery research found that ~25% of survey respondents felt the website’s UI/UX could be improved. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents could not find all the information they sought. In descending order, the top three categories of information sought are: 

1. Volunteer opportunities 
2. Current project information 
3. Other - Includes information about GitHub and Python workshops, working examples of past successful projects, what goes on at Meetup meetings, and whether beginner-level technologists can join.  

The current presentation of project cards on the home page forces users to scroll in a cumbersome way through one or more pages. This makes it difficult to find and locate projects of interest quickly. And the project cards do not provide a clear call to action to prospective volunteers.
