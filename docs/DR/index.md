# Decision Records

This wiki page serves as the central hub for all decision records. Decision records help the team keep track of the decisions that have been made, along with the details and rationale behind them. Each decision record includes a status label (✅ Adopted or ⛔ Not Implemented) to clearly indicate its implementation status, even in the case of navigation issues.

## How to Use Decision Records

### For Volunteers

As a volunteer, you can use decision records to gain insight into the project's history and understand the reasons behind key decisions. Decision records can help you:

1. Learn about previous decisions and their rationale.
2. Understand the project's current state and adopted practices.
3. Identify areas for improvement or potential new solutions.

### For Development Leads

As a development lead, decision records serve as a valuable resource for:

1. Onboarding new team members, as they can review previous decisions to get up to speed.
2. Maintaining a historical record of project decisions, providing context and rationale for future reference.
3. Evaluating the impact of past decisions and guiding future choices.

## Decision Record Workflow

For detailed instructions on creating, updating, or removing decision records, please refer to the [Decision Records Management](decision_records_management.md) guide provides step-by-step instructions for developers to manage decision records efficiently and with minimal manual effort.

By using decision records and following the guidelines outlined in this wiki, both volunteers and development leads can effectively track, understand, and contribute to the project's decision-making process.
