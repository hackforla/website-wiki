# Decision Records

This wiki page serves as the central hub for all decision records. Decision records help the team keep track of the decisions that have been made, along with the details and rationale behind them.

Each decision record includes a status label (✅ Adopted or ⛔ Not Implemented) to clearly indicate its implementation status, even in the case of navigation issues. Adopted and Not Implemented decision record templates are available to streamline the creation process and maintain consistency across records.

## Decision Record Workflow

For detailed instructions on creating decision records, please refer to the [Decision Records Management](decision-records-management.md) guide.
