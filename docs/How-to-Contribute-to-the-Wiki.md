### Instructions
We are currently in the process of moving the old wiki to the new [website-wiki repo](https://github.com/hackforla/website-wiki), so we will not be making any changes or additions to the wiki at this time. 
#### Creating a new wiki page
- If you are creating a new page, please draft the content of your wiki page in a new comment in your issue and then add a link to your comment in the `Content to be Added/Edited in the New website-wiki Repo` section below, so we know to add or edit the content you wrote up to the new website-wiki repo.
#### Editing a Wiki page
- If you are editing an existing wiki page, please copy and paste the contents of the wiki page in a new comment in your issue. Then, in the comment you just created, you can edit the wiki page's content and then add a link to your comment in the `Content to be Added/Edited in the New website-wiki Repo` section below, so we know to add or edit the content you wrote up to the new website-wiki repo.
