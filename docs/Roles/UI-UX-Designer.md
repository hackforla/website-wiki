### Overall Design Team goals
Improve the website and user flows of Donors, Partners, and Volunteers, to make their tasks easier, more intuitive and enjoyable.  At the same time we need to have content that educates and gets all user demographics excited about what Hack for LA has to offer.

### Current Status of website
We are at the end of the Hack for LA Home page relaunch. We are making sure all pages that are navigable and linked from the homepage are accounted for and built properly. We are also working to make sure that the design system can be more effectively and efficiently used.

### Future Direction
After the new site launches with improvements and pages in January we will then be able to greatly start improving the user experience for all user demographics.
