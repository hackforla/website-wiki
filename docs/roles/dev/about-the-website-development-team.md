# About the Website Development Team

## Team Levels

When you join, you'll start at Level 1 and go through a learning process. The goal is to get you familiar with how we do things. Once you've learned enough and are doing well, you can move on to a Level 2 team for more advanced work.

- **Front-end**: Our front-end is built using the following languages and libraries:
    - HTML

    - GitHub Actions
    - Google Apps Script
