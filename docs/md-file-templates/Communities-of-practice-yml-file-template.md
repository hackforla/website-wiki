**Sample recruiting message:** 

If you've been working on a Hack for LA project for a month or more and are interested in organizing this group, join us at the Project/Product Management Community of Practice meeting to talk about how we can help you get this off the ground (the project leads will be able to get the word out to their project team).


**Slack link for leadership**

To create a Slack link for each person, go to the project's Slack channel, find a message from that person. Click on their name; this should give you a popup window with the user's picture, name, and a link to "View full profile". Click on "View full profile". That pane gives you the options message, call, and more. Click on "more" and you should be shown "Copy member ID" followed by the actual id. This is the id you need to use in the slack url, e.g. https://app.slack.com/team/<member_id_here`
