This update motivates a team member to reflect on their work on an issue for the past week, the work still remaining, and the blockers to completing the issue. It also communicate to other team members that you are actively contributing to the team even when you cannot make meetings or respond to messages. A progress report has 5 parts:</p> <ul> <li>Progress: \"What is the current status of your project? What have you completed and what is left to do?\"</li> <li>Blockers: \"Difficulties or errors encountered.\"</li> <li>Availability: \"How much time will you have this week to work on this issue?\"</li> <li>ETA: \"When do you expect this issue to be completed?\"</li> <li>Pictures: \"Add any pictures of the visual changes made to the site so far.\"</li> </ul> <p>The ideal time to give a progress update would be on Friday or Saturday, ahead of the Sunday meeting. This gives you a chance to ask for help on the Sunday meeting should you realize that you need more information to complete your issue. Optionally, you can also put the the <code>Status: Help Wanted</code> label on your issue. This signals to the team that you need help, and anyone from the team can come and assist you with your blockers.</p> <p>To effectively communicate your blockers, be sure to supply as much information as possible when writing the progress update, such as pictures, and very specific questions. This way a team member would not need to guess what your blockers are and can provide specific help and feedback for your issue.</p> <p>Note: If an update is not made over a period of 2 weeks, the issue becomes labeled <code>2 weeks inactive</code>, meaning that it has a chance of being unassigned. To prevent this, make sure to update regularly, even if a pull request is made. </p> <p>Return to top</p>"},{"location":"pending-audit/how-to/how-to-communicate-with-the-team/#how-to-help-a-team-member-with-their-blockers","title":"How to Help a Team Member with their Blockers","text":"<p>At HackForLA, we encourage team members to help one another with blockers on their issues.

If you have never mentored someone before, here are a few guidelines that can help:</p> <ul> <li>The very first step is to listen. Make sure to understand their blockers before giving a response, or assuming what the issue is about.</li> <li>Ask lots of questions! Sometimes blockers are not really blockers at all. Someone might not be asking themselves the right questions. Asking questions is how you can guide someone towards the right answer.</li> <li>Give links to documentation. Documentation is helpful, since it can be bookmarked, and referenced later.</li> <li>Offer to figure it out together. Often, we do not know how to solve a blocker ourselves, but by working on it together with someone, the task becomes much easier. Two heads are better than one!</li> <li>Schedule a time to pair program. Pair programming is a good way to provide hands-on help.</li> <li>Ask for help when needed.

Issues of a smaller size tend to have clearer items, such as, \"locate the line that says, 'font-size: 16px', and change it to, 'font-size: 12px'. However, as issues grow larger, the item might be less clear, such as, \"change the font size for all titles to 12px\", or \"look at the Figma file for the font size, and change the font to match\".

Do I review a pull request if someone has already made a review?    &gt;Yes! In fact, all pull requests require review by either 1 senior developer or 2 junior developers to merge. When reviewing a pull request with an existing review, be sure to check the previous review, so that you do not end up asking for the same changes.   2. After I request changes, do I need to review the pull request again after changes are made?     &gt;As people lead busy lives, it can be difficult to keep track of and re-review a pull request, although we recommend you do so. It helps with our workflow, since, as the person who requested changes, you understand, more than others, the changes needed to be made.    3. Are there any limits to what pull requests I can review?    &gt;Yes, we do have recommended guidelines for contributors when choosing which request to review.

The website must achieve two key goals:  1. Present a clear and compelling value proposition for participation; 1. Enable interested volunteers to identify and join projects that align with their areas of interest and skills.    Earlier HFLA discovery research found that ~25% of survey respondents felt the website\u2019s UI/UX could be improved. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents could not find all the information they sought. In descending order, the top three categories of information sought are:   1. Volunteer opportunities  2. Current project information  3. Other - Includes information about GitHub and Python workshops, working examples of past successful projects, what goes on at Meetup meetings, and whether beginner-level technologists can join.    The current presentation of project cards on the home page forces users to scroll in a cumbersome way through one or more pages.

These files are named after their triggers. For example, in the below snippet, the GHA triggers on a pull request that is either opened, closed, or edited.</p> Note on wr-pull-request-trigger.yml  The wr-pull-request-trigger.yml file is based on a workflow run trigger. This trigger basically means \"run this after this GHA finished running\". Sometimes this is used if the results of one or more past actions can be further used to perform an additional task. For example, pull request triggers can often be dangerous since it runs in the context of the repository that made the pull request, a context that a user have limited controlled. The workflow run trigger moves the context into the repository that the pull request is trying to merge into. For more information on security, take a look at the tips below for articles on security!  Note on the other files  The other files in that folder are GHAs that has not yet been incorporated into issue-trigger.yml, lint-scss.yml, or pull-request-trigger.yml. These files, depending on their triggering condition, should eventually be refactored into them (in fact, there are probably issues on them if you type in 'refactoring ghas' in the issue search bar.  Note on the scheduled triggers  Based on our naming scheme, you might be wondering about how we name scheduled triggers. Although there are currently files that work on a scheduled trigger, they had not been renamed yet. For those files, they should be named based on when they activate, such as \"Schedule Daily 1300\", \"Scheduled Monthly\", or \"Scheduled Friday 0700\".  <p><code>pull-request-trigger.yml</code> <pre><code>name: Pull Request Trigger\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, closed, edited]\n    branches:\n      - 'gh-pages'\n</code></pre></p> <p>Further more, these triggers are further subdivided through if-else clauses into different jobs, or actions that are taken when the trigger condition is fulfilled. In the below snippet, there are two overarching jobs: Add-Issue-Labels-To-PR and Add-Reviewers-To-New-PR. These jobs only activate when a pull request is opened. Once activated, they perform a series of instructions, called steps (which is not written out here to conserve space).  These steps are usually written in <code>ubuntu</code> commandline code, which is a powerful language for file maintenance and manipulation (those familiar with commandline code will realize that GHAs are a lot like cron jobs).</p> <p><code>pull-request-trigger.yml</code> <pre><code>jobs:\n  Add-Issue-Labels-To-PR:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Only trigger when a new PR is created\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull-request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'opened'}}\n    steps:\n      - run: echo \"Hello World! \ud83c\udf89\"\n      ...\n  Add-Reviewers-To-New-PR:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Only trigger when a new PR is created\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull-request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'opened'}}\n    steps:\n      - run: echo \"Hello World! \ud83c\udf89\"\n      ...\n</code></pre></p> <p>To summarize, the thing to remember about these files are that they are named after triggers, and that each job uses if/else clauses to specify the specific trigger that causes the GHA to run.</p> <p>Return to top</p>"},{"location":"roles/dev/pending-audit/github-actions/hack-for-las-github-actions/#github-actions-directory","title":"github-actions Directory","text":"<p>For most developers, the <code>ubuntu shell</code> is either too arcane or too lacking to perform very tailored actions. Therefore, we often abstract away the <code>ubuntu</code> code by running an external JS file instead. This external file, and all files that support it, lives in the second GHA directory: the github-actions directory.</p> <p>The github-actions directory houses all the JS files that are called or used by the .yml files in the .github/workflows. These files are usually called via two external modules called actions/checkout@v2 and actions/github-script@v4. Their functions will not be detailed here, as that can be found in their documentation. However, I will say that these two work in tandem to allow GHAs to call our JS files.</p> <p><code>issue-trigger.yml</code> <pre><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2      \n  - name: Check Labels\n    uses: actions/github-script@v4\n    id: check-labels\n    with:\n      script: |\n        const script = require('./github-actions/trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js')\n        const checkLabels = script({g: github, c: context})\n        return checkLabels\n  - name: Post Comment\n    uses: actions/github-script@v4\n    with:\n       script: |\n         const results = ${{ steps.check-labels.outputs.result }}\n         const script = require('./github-actions/trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/post-labels-comment.js')\n         script({g: github, c:context}, results)\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the above sample, you will notice that the script is called by giving it a github and context object.

These names are there to broadly define the steps of that particular action.</p> <p>Also, note the path of the called JS files, trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js and trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js. These paths follow the pattern of trigger/jobname/stepname.js. This organization allows us to very quickly locate the JS file that is associated with some action, and quickly surmise its purpose. This helps us edit the files quickly, since most GHAs involves very similar tasks, and so a very nested structure is needed to not confuse files such as add-update-label-weekly.js vs add-label-on-issue-creation.js.</p> <p>Jumping into the github-actions directory, you will see four main directories: trigger-issue, trigger-pr, trigger-schedule, and utils.

View GitHub\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\"&gt;Mastering Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for a simple guide.&lt;/em&gt;\nin-this-guide: \n  - name: Example of a Good End-to-End Issue\n    link: '#example-issue'\n  - name: Issue Sections - Description and Tips\n    link: '#issue-sections'\n  - name: Issue Template\n    link: '#issue-template'\n  - name: Member Analytics\n    link: '#member-analytics'\n---\n\n&lt;HTML CODE GOES HERE&gt;\n</code></pre></p> <p>HTML is placed after the front matter to populate the content, as each guide page is uniquely structured. In the <code>guide-pages.html</code> layout file, you'll see  <code>{{ content | markdownify }}</code>, which is a Liquid filter that helps with converting the code below the front matter into HTML. </p> <p>To help keep the guide page elements consistent and DRY, styling for the majority of elements have been created in the <code>_guide-pages.scss</code> file, and are demonstrated below. Please note the tags and classes used as you create your guide page. </p> <p> </p> <p>To add unique formats or styles, create a Sass file inside the <code>_sass/components/guide-pages</code> folder, with a name that corresponds to your markdown file. Don't forget to import your new Sass file in the main  <code>_sass/main.scss</code> file with the other guide pages.</p> <p>To add images, or to reuse images (such as arrows), see the  <code>assets/images/guides</code> folder. Create a folder to add the images for your guide page.</p> <p>Return to Contents </p>"},{"location":"roles/dev/pending-audit/site-architecture/hack-for-las-site-architecture/#styling","title":"Styling","text":"<p>If you're new or unfamiliar with SASS, take a look at these links below:  1.

It can be used with the <code>@use</code> rule and the name of a partial must be prefixed with an <code>_</code>, doing so notifies Sass that it is a partial file, as to prevent it from being generated into a CSS file.</li> <li>Modules: Modules can also be used with the  <code>@use</code> rule (you can pass in the module name without the extension: i.e. <code>@use 'example';</code>). The rule also allows you to use the variables, mixins, and functions of the module passed in.</li> <li>Mixins: Similar to variables, mixins are a good way to keep code DRY. However, instead of using a variable to store a small piece of information, mixins are used to store chunks of code to be reused over and over. Mixins can be used with <code>@include mixin-name</code>. A good use of mixins would be to store values for vendor prefixes.</li> <li>Extend/Inheritance: The use of <code>@extend</code> allows you to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. A selector that is to be shared will be prefixed with <code>%</code>.</li> <li>Operators: Sass allows the use of standard math operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"roles/dev/pending-audit/site-architecture/hack-for-las-site-architecture/#styling-files","title":"Styling Files","text":"<p>All of Hack for LA's styling files are contained in _sass. 1.

See the Files section for more information about project meetings.</li> <li>Project Languages     While most information for a project is pulled from its markdown file, languages for projects are pulled from a project's Github API. See the project layout wiki for additional detail. </li> <li>Project Contributors     Similar to project languages, project contributors are also pulled from Github's list. Currently, the contributors list is showing members based on commits (individuals who have made more Github commits show up on top of the list). We are working on a way to use Github to also include members who contribute to discussions or project issues (i.e. UI/UX designers) without commiting code. See the project layout wiki for additional detail on how the contributor information is pulled from the API. </li> <li>Action Network     Hack for LA is currently using Action Network to collect and store an email subscription list for users who are interested in receiving updates from Hack for LA. The script for embedding the API into the sign up forms can be found in assets\\js\\api-actionnetwork.js. The script is using the DOM to create and embed Action Network into the signup form, and sending any submissions to Action Network. </li> <li>Hotjar Hotjar is a behavior analytics tool that we are using to analyze how visitors are interacting with the Hack for LA site. However, since the free tier of Hotjar provides 3 funnels, we are limited to tracking only Home page and the Getting Started page.

Similar to Bootstrap, the button class related to color is called .btn-primary instead of .btn-pink to allow for future color changes.</p> <p>Now the style of a specific button is also easy to quickly adjust, by switching class names in the html depending on the component size, color, etc. that you want.
